# Makefile++

Some experimental, fun makefile features.
The makefile contains some functional code thanks to shell commands and *technically* can be used as a functional programming language.

If you uncomment the later code, you will notice that each `make` command removes some code, after 3 commands, you cant run `make` anymore. Magic!
